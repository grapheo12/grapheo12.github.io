I am an undergrad at IIT Kharagpur, pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering.
My areas of technical interests are **Backend development**, **Cryptography**, **Cyber Security** and **Distributed Systems**.
In my leisure time, I watch a lot of web-series and animes and play guitar.
I like to write poems based on current affairs and human emotions.


I am an Open Source Enthusiast and currently am an advisor at [Kharagpur Open Source Society](https://kossiitkgp.org/).
I keep on giving talks on various tech topics time to time.

I am writing this on a Lenovo Thinkpad running **Fedora 34**.
