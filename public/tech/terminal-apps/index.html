            <p>The traditional GUI based applications for general purpose use are
typically built for the laymen. But we ain't no laymen, are we? We are
developers: productivity is the key to our sustainance.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Majority of the GUI based applications come with some extra features
that we don't even care to use. The first step towards choosing such
bloat-free app, in my opinion, is to do away with the GUI itself and
focus on simple apps that only do what they are supposed to do.</p>
<p>Now I am not talking about doing everything in a shell. Some tasks like
Web Browsing, Image and Video playing, editing and recording are better
done using graphical applications.</p>
<p>Apart from that, pretty much everything can be done through the
terminal.</p>
<h2 id="major-advantages-of-using-the-terminal">Major advantages of using the terminal</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lightweight interface</strong>: Most terminal apps either take input from
the argument variables or provide <em>Ncurses</em> base TUI to play with.
Thses are way lighter on the RAM than traditional GUI frameworks
like QT or GTK.</li>
<li><strong>No mouse involved</strong>: Terminal apps rely solely on the keyboard for
input. So the time wasted to find an option or menu by clicking is
reduced. Most apps come with man-pages to help you if you get stuck.</li>
<li><strong>Low dependency</strong>: These app rely on very few dependencies. Hence
the download size is quite low. Apps can work standalone.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="some-terminal-apps-you-should-use">Some terminal apps you SHOULD use</h2>
<p>Let me introduce some cool terminal apps that easily win over their GUI
counterparts.</p>
<h3 id="vim">Vim</h3>
<p>For most people, Vim is an obscure text editor. But for Vim users, it's
a way of life. I am writing this article in Vim. The learning curve is
steep. But once you get used to it, it takes over your mind.</p>
<p><strong>Vi</strong> comes installed in almost all Linux distros. Vim is an
improved version of Vi. It's highly configurable through the
<strong>.vimrc</strong>. You can even install themes and plugins to add on
to your experience.</p>
<p>Vim is a modal text editor. Meaning: when it opens files, it is meant
for reading and minor editing (<em>Normal</em> mode). You switch to <em>Insert</em>
mode to type text. There are other modes, eg <em>Visual</em> mode for
selection, <em>Visual (Block)</em> mode for block selection and editing etc.</p>
<h3 id="ranger">Ranger</h3>
<p>It is a terminal based File Manager. It's extremely fast and
configurable.</p>
<p>The best thing about ranger is its ability to do bulk operations on
files. For example, bulk rename, bulk delete etc.</p>
<p>And the second best thing is that it supports Vim keybindings. :-)</p>
<h3 id="cmus">Cmus</h3>
<p>Cmus is a terminal music player. It too uses Vim-like keybindings.</p>
<p>It is meant for blazing fast processing of music data spanning many GBs.
Even being a terminal app, it integrates with the GNOME taskbar very
well.</p>
<h3 id="nmtui">nmtui</h3>
<p>It is a Terminal utility for the <strong>NetworkManager</strong> service.</p>
<p>If you are using a minimal Window manager, in my opinion,
<strong>nmtui</strong> is far better tool to configure connections than the
<strong>nm-applet</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="amixer">amixer</h3>
<p>It is the sound management utility provided by ALSA. It is extremely
intuitive and easy to use.</p>
<h2 id="ending-notes">Ending Notes</h2>
<p>I am slowly discovering this world of free and open source utilities.
Hence the list is quite short here. But I intend to add more as I use.</p>
<p>Of particular mention, is the Suckless project, that aims at making
bloat-free software. I did not include their products as I have not used
them.</p>
<p>This post is heavily inspired by DistroTube and Luke Smith. Do check out
their YouTube channels.</p>
